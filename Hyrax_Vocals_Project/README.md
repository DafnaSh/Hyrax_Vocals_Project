This is the partial public version of the code written in the Hyrax Vocals project.

Project Scripts Folder: Contains individual separate scripts I created to locate and copy filles from different locations, create csv files in certain formats, validate content etc...

Project Automation Folder: Automation of processes in the web application Koe (https://koe.io.ac.nz/) - such as uploading files and choosing acoustic features.

Notes:
* The commit comments of this version left vague intensely. 
* Since the code was created for my personal use, there is no GUI and the inputs are hardcoded.
* The Project Automation code was created using the web version available at the time (june 2022).
